# Dotfiles / configuration with Chezmoi


TODO:

- Add `.config` files/dirs
- Investigate adding from home dir:
    - `.ptpython/config.py`
    - `.ssh`
    - `.kde`
    - `.local/share`
    - `.tmux` (tpm)
- Is anything in `.config/JetBrains` super ephemeral? Real-time sync w/
  syncthing...?
  - Okay, similar stuff is... `~/.local/share/color-schemes`
  - `.local/share/color-schemes`
  - `.local/share/fish`
